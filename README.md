Simple ffmpeg based application for transcoding, audio extraction and splitting of media files.

It provides the possibility:
- to add, delete and update time point(s) where to split manually or using the built-in media player
- to create user defined output part names
- to use input file internal chapters names and their timecodes as a base for custom splitting    
- playlist generation (m3u8).
  
## Input:
### - one or more audio or video files
